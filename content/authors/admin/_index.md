I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor studying social behavior in the digital age. My primary advisor is [Dr. Ethan Kross](http://selfcontrol.psych.lsa.umich.edu). Broadly, I work with mixed methods to identify psychosocial forces influencing emotional expression and interpersonal communication on the Internet and on social media, with a focus on distinguishing these forces from those shaping in-person behavior.
